Error 
    ==> Thread Death
    ==> IO Error
    ==> Virtual Machine Error
    ==> Out Of Memory

Errors - We can not handle Errors.

Exception - we can handle the Exceptions.

Types Of Exceptions

     ==> Run time Exceptions -- ( Un Checked Exceptions ) 
            --> Arithmetic Exception
            --> Array Index Out Of Bounds Exception
            --> Null Pointer Exception

     ==> SQL Exceptions  == > Checked Exceptions
     ==> IO Exceptions   == > Checked Exceptions

==> Key Points
    * Run Time Exceptions can be handled or not but as a good programmer we should handle the Exceptions.
    * Remaining Exceptions can must be handled.
