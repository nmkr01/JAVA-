            ** Exceptions **
==> Exceptions are basically the run time errors.
==> Types of Exceptions
        * Compile Time errors - Errors that occur during the runtime
        * Run Time errors - We need to handle the runtime errors.
            ==> Run Time Errors are Exceptions, we need to handle the exceptions.
        * Logical errors - Sometimes we didn't get the expected output and we get some different output, then we call it as Logical Errors
